# Technical Q&A Panel Questions

## Expectations
This panel lasts 1 hour and occurs during the 6th week of senior phase, and generally has 2 - 3 panelists and a host. The first *20 minutes* are geared questions (see below) about the panelists' experience, going from a higher level understanding of their job hunt to more specific questions about each person's experience.

The next *40 minutes* is open to student questions, but feel free to pull from this list if there are no questions. We do not need to hit them all.

### General Questions
1. Tell us a little bit about your past experience (how you got here?) and your job hunting process.
2. How often have you been in the job hunt, and how long did it take for you to land your first role?
3. What was your daily schedule? What did you focus on during your hunt?

### Success Rates/Expectations
1. What is the ratio: number of jobs you applied for, number of jobs you heard back from, number of phone screens, number of on-sites, number of offers.
2. What is the ratio: system design, algorithms, general JS questions, other.
3. How long should your responses be to questions?
4. How successful was cold-applying to companies?
5. When going through the interview questions, in hindsight, do you think they expected you to get them all right, or was there a different intention behind the conversation?
6. Regarding algorithms specifically, does the REACTO process work, and what would you add/change about it to more accurately reflect what interviewers want?
7. If I don't know what I want yet, is that okay? Should I expect to know what I want in company culture?

### Experience/Stories
1. Can you tell us about a time you felt you werenâ€™t doing well in the interview and how you navigated the rest of that time?
2. What was your worst interview experience, and why?
3. Are you able to tell what the company is like based off the interview? What are some key tells/red flags, or... green lights?
4. What was your very first technical phone screen like? Very first onsite?

### Advice
1. What advice do you have about the overall job hunt process?
2. What advice do you have when prepping for a phone screen? When prepping for an on-site?
3. What advice do you have when going into an interview?
4. How do you stagger interviews? Sometimes, we don't get them in the order that we'd want, and timing doesn't work out. How do you choose to to place one onsite near another phone screen? Do you just jumble them all at once, or do you spread them out as far as possible? Does your schedule change drastically during that time?
5. Do you have any advice on calming your nerves?
6. Do you have any sites/places that you went to to study that you would suggest?
7. How do you maintain a constant flow every day? What do you do to stay grounded and centered?
