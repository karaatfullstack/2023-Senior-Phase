  * Day 2: Team Contract; Github Org created
  * Day 3: Project tasks breakdown (get MVP on the project board)
  * Day 4: Wireframes, schema, tech stack. Proof of concept (the "crux" of the MVP)
* Instructors may want to use a milestone tracking form for fellows to fill out, and link the responses to your cohort spreadsheet.
  * [Example form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KUiD48dhi42bbn8A2btwnyoizOqCwKIsvRHITlB7nD8/edit)

#### Notes

* Students should **not use Camtasia anymore** to make their screencast.
  * Use iMovie, movie maker online, or any other free software.
* When seeking help from an Instructor, students should seek advisement from those assigned to their cohort. If an instructor wishes to delegate to a colleague in a different cohort/program (due to technical expertise or previous experience with the students), they may deign to do so. Students should not be seeking out the help of instructors assigned to different cohorts unless directly asked to.
