# FSA Lesson Plan

## REACTO - Object Oriented Design

### Daily Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Build activity diagrams for a few simple products, highlighting opportunities to leverage core OOP design principles

### Needs Statement

Students need to be able to split a system into various components as well as indentify who are the major actors of that system are and their various user stories. This will be helpful to them as many companies still use OOP Design Principles in their codebases.

### Key Topics

- Activity Diagriam
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

### Format

- The Core Principles of OOP
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
- Object Composition
- Actors of a System
- Activity Diagrams
    - ATM Walkthrough
- Class Diagrams
    - ATM Walkthrough

### Resources

- Instructors can use the old [ATM](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/technical-interview-prep/blob/master/archive/algorithms/9-system-design/oop/atm.md) REACTO for the Activity Diagram and Class Diagram walkthroughs in the lecture

### Notes

- The currently linked video is from the first iteration of OOP Design done in 1904. The current iteration hasn't changed much other than adding the idea of "Actors" and "Nouns & Verbs" in the context of a system.
