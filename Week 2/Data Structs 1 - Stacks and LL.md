# FSA Lesson Plan

## REACTO - Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists

### Daily Objectives
Students will be able to:
- Identify appropriate use cases for stacks and queues in different types of problems (obvious versus elusive)
- Manipulate linked lists (singly/doubly) and re-orient them when needed using PBR assignment (via code demo)
  - Example: Delete Node from LL

**Note:** This lecture also falls under an assumption that students _know_ what stacks, queue, and LLs are, and how to build them, and has a _small_ review.

**Note:** This lecture is focused on recognizing points that they will _actually see_ in real problems in both REACTOs and in industry. There are _many_ other strategies and resources for all of these situations, but this is the _necessary foundation_ for their toolset. If there are other tools that you believe are important, please include your own examples or links to different resources.

### Needs Statement
Students need to identify appropriate use-cases for stacks and queues, as well as manipulate linked lists using the tools and examples provided, in order to add to an arsenal of problem solving tools for interview problems. These tools and examples are part of a greater need to identify _when_ we need to use these options, and _how_ to manipulate a very common data structure.

### Key Topics
Problem Solving Topics/Strategies (mostly high level):
- Stacks & Queues Usage In Problems
- Approaches Discussion (student-driven)
- Linked List Node Manipulation

### Pre-reading
Lecture Videos from Linked List & Stacks & Queues Day of Junior Phase

### Lesson

#### Lesson Plan Schedule (45 minutes)
- Stacks
  - Review (2 min)
  - When do we see them in action?
  - Explain via Next Greater Element approach. Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/sarahzhao25/176ac9d5b33e8c2964ce3c5d6014b76b) (~10 min)
- Queues
  - Review (2 min)
  - When do we see them in action?
- Approach: Stack or Queue? (~20 min)
  - Present 4 - 6 problems
  - 3 min discussions (maybe more time if they're harder)

- Review Linked Lists (singly/doubly) - 5 minutes (CFU)
  - Talk about how LL will _rarely_ come up as a data structure to _BUILD_, so we'll talk more about _how to manipulate it_.
  - Time complexity of navigating through a LL usually at least O(n)
- prev, curr, next -> manipulation (delete Node situation) - 10 mins
  - Repl [here](https://repl.it/@sarahzhao25/linkedlistmanipulation)
