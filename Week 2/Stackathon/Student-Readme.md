# Stackathon

## Learning Objectives

- Build a project of your own design and volition over a brief weekend hackathon
- Teach yourself a new technology, language, or framework

## Presentations

- Students will present their projects (or learning moments) for one-another science-fair style
- Presentations will take place on Monday, 1/23/23


### Format

- Pre-record a 3-5 min video presenting your Stackathon and upload it to YouTube
- Students will be split into groups of ~6, where they will present their pre-recorded video in a Zoom breakout room.
- Discussion between presentations is encouraged :)
- _**Note**: Please do not record more than 5 minutes of footage due to the amount of presentations we will have that day._

### Preparation

- Have notes available to guide your recording, and practice before recording
- Make sure your microphone is audible and clear when speaking
- Do short test recordings to verify your settings are adequate

* For further inspiration, see this list of possible topics: [AWP Technologies List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aApC_9G1tG1q3LfCfliUPHrK7NF2d3K9_Wu4mPT9BpY/edit#gid=1476839564)


## Presentation Content

Introduce what the project is, the story behind it, and what interested in you the project.

### User Story

If you have something to present, walk everyone through a user story of your app. Or if you don't have a user story, you can walk through the working parts of your app. Or if you really don't have much to show, a slide deck of a few slides of what you were trying to would suffice.

### The Technologies

Give us a rundown on what technologies you used and what are the technologies that you learned on your own outside the curriculum.

### The Challenges

- What did you learn?
- What major challenges did you face?

### Advice and Epilogue

- What advice would you give future developers pursuing this project?
- What would you have done differently?
- Would you use the same stack or use something different?

### Future Features

- Where does your vision take you?
- If you are working on it after graduation, what part of it will you immediately start working on again?

## Notes
- Students will submit their recorded videos via Canvas
- Stackathon ideas do not need to be "approved" before moving forward.
- Rather than pick an entirely new topics, students are encouraged to build upon their async-week for Stackathon. 
  - This is NOT required, and ultimately you may choose any topic that interests you within the realm of computer science.
