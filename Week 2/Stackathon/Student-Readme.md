# Stackathon

## Learning Objectives

- Build a project of your own design and volition over a brief weekend hackathon
  - If you don't have a project built, make a powerpoint or summary of what you learned
- Teach yourself a new technology, language, or framework
  - If your Async Week project fits this category, we recommend that you expand on it for your Stackathon
- Although this is usually an individual project, you may work with a partner if desired.
  - If you work with a partner, you should each do about half of the presentation. 

* For inspiration, see this list of possible topics: [AWP Technologies List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aApC_9G1tG1q3LfCfliUPHrK7NF2d3K9_Wu4mPT9BpY/edit#gid=1476839564)
  * This is far from an exhaustive list - pick anything you want! These are just possibilities. 

## Presentations

- Students will present their projects (or learning moments) in class
- Presentations will take place on Wednesday, June 21st


### Format

- Give a live lecture OR pre-record a 3-5 min video presenting your Stackathon 
  - There will be time for questions/discussion between presentations :)
- _**Note**: Please don't plan for more than a 5 minute presentation due to the amount we will have that day._
  - If working in a pair, please keep the presentation to < 10 minutes

### Preparation

- Have notes available to guide your recording or lecture
- If recording, do a short test to verify your settings are adequate 

## Presentation Content

Introduce what the project is, the story behind it, and what interested in you the project.

### User Story

If you have something to present, walk everyone through a user story of your app. Or if you don't have a user story, you can walk through the working parts of your app. Or if you really don't have much to show, a slide deck of a few slides of what you were trying to do would suffice.

### The Technologies

Give us a rundown on what technologies you used and what technologies you learned on your own outside the curriculum.

### The Challenges

- What did you learn?
- What major challenges did you face?

### Advice and Epilogue

- What advice would you give future developers pursuing this project?
- What would you have done differently?
- Would you use the same stack or use something different next time?

### Future Features

- Where does your vision take you?
- If you were to work on it after graduation, what part of it would you start on?

## Notes
- Students will submit their recorded videos. If doing a live lecture, it will be recorded for our class Youtube channel.
- Stackathon ideas do not need to be "approved" before moving forward.
- There will be minimal assistance from the instructional team with this project. Each project is highly-specific to your topic, and will likely be difficult for an outsider to troubleshoot.
  - For this reason, we recommend starting small, and taking incremental steps toward additional features.
- Rather than pick an entirely new topics, students are encouraged to build upon their async-week for Stackathon. 
  - Using your async topic is NOT required, and ultimately you may choose any topic that interests you within the realm of computer science/ gaming/ web development.
  - There is no 'failing' this project, as long as you can present what you've learned.
