#### Presentations

#### Objectives

    * Students will present their projects (or learning moments) for one-another science-fair style.


#### Format

* Students will pre-record a 3-5 min video presenting their Stackathon and upload it to YouTube (much like with AWP)
* Students will be split into groups of ~5-10 students, where they will present their pre-recorded video in a pre-assigned Zoom room or breakout room.
* Discussion between presentations is encouraged :)
* _**Note**: Please do not record more than 5 minutes of footage due to the amount of presentations we will all be watching on that same day._

#### Preparation

- If necessary have notes available to guide your recording to improve smoothness
- If public speaking is difficult for you, try practicing before recording
- Make sure your microphone is audible and clear when speaking
- Do some test recordings to verify your settings are adequate

#### Potential Topics to Cover

##### Your Vision

Introduce what the project is, the story behind it, and what interested in you the project.

##### User Story

If you have something to present, walk everyone through a user story of your app. Or if you don't have a user story, you can walk through the working parts of your app. Or if you really don't have much to show, a slide deck of a few slides of what you were trying to would suffice.

##### The Technologies

Give us a rundown on what technologies you used and what are the technologies that you learned on your own outside the curriculum.

##### The Challenges

- What did you learn?
- What major challenges did you face?

##### Advice and Postmortem

- What advice would you give future developers pursuing this project?
- What would you have done differently?
- Would you use the same stack or use something different?

##### Future Features

- Where does your vision take you?
- If you are working on it after graduation, what part of it will you immediately start working on again?

##### Submission (Remote only)

- Students will submit their recorded videos via Canvas

#### Notes

* Instructors may deign how/if they wish to hold Office Hours for Stackathon idea generation.
* Stackathon ideas do not need to be "approved" before moving forward.
* It is _highly recommended_ that students continue working on their AWP for Stackathon, though not required.
