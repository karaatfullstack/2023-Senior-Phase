# Technical Mock Interview

## Overview

A major city has finally realized how beneficial it would be for its citizens to be able to track public transit and see how far away their next ride is! Luckily for you, the city has placed you in charge of designing the system!

### Question

#### Design a Public Transit Tracker (30 mins)

**The mayor's requirement**:

- Consumers needs to be able to get information about the location of the buses and trains in relation to which stop they request via SMS text message, API, and via a website.


**Information the mayor has given us**:

- Each bus/subway train has a GPS tracker on it that will automatically send an HTTP request every minute with configurable data to the database. 
- Our system is able to send SMS messages with a single function call by first converting the SMS to an HTTP request, waiting for a response from the server, and then converting the response back to an SMS text message. 
- Each run has a specific id associated with it, which includes information the vehicle and the route that the vehicle is completing. (ie. #8528 is a specific vehicle completing a Blue Line run)

**Task**:
 
Think through and diagram the different components of this public transport tracker. 
We can assume that the public transit system is made up of buses and subway/trains only. You have access to the following routes:


     GET /:stopID
        request body: {route: xxx, stopId: xxx, include active runs on that route where distance in time from stop < 30   mins }
        response body: {buses that meet the criteria and remaining minutes until they reach the stop}
        
        *if the request is coming from an SMS text message, it will first be converted into an HTTP request
         
     PUT /routes / id
       request body: {route: req.params.id, status: out of service}
     
     PUT vehicle/ id
      request body: {vehicle: req.params.id, status: out of service}

#### Solution

- [DB Schema](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ki4qJ-hZ4lgewXySogIWjQO1VBhzT9Mh/view?usp=sharing)

- [Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ENATbli-eQLSiCsUabBxkS9ArEr9TUXj/view?usp=sharing)

**Nouns:**

- Routes
- Vehicle (bus or traincar)
- Runs (ie #4567 would be a specific vehile completing a route)
- Stops
- GPS locator on each vehicle

**Verbs:**

- Start run - info needed: vehicle, route, and run number
- Location and time updated once per minute 
- Calculate distance in time to the next stop - if the time is less than 1 minute, display "due" instead
- Handling changes in service, such as:
  - delays
  - express routes in which vehicles skip stops
  - Vehicle breaks down and is now out of service 
  - ReRoute - a run has to take a different route due to construction, etc

**User Stories**:

*Users:*

1. **SMS Text Request:** Each bus stop has a sign with information about which buses stop there, what time routes run, a bus stop id number, and phone number that users can text to receive information about which buses are scheduled to arrive within the next 30 minutes. The user will send a text to the number listed on the sign with a 4 digit code specific to the bus stop that they would like to receive information about. The user receives an SMS response with the list of buses approaching that stop within in the next 30 minutes.  
2. **Transit Tracker App or Website:** The user has an app on their phone or is using a website to view a list of upcoming buses or trains that are approaching. The user navigates to a "View Stops" page and selects their stop from a list of all stops. The user is redirect to a list view of all approaching buses or trains within the next 30 minutes. Each bus/train listed has information about which direction it's headed, as well as how many minutes until it arrives at the stop.  

*System Admins:*

3. **All vehicles on a route are re-routed due to construction:** The system administrator is notified that a route will be closed due to construction, which means that any bus/trains that normally use that route will have to be re-routed(aka assigned a new route). The system administrator navigates to that vehicle and clicks the "out of service" button. The system admin can select which route the buses/trains will be re-routed to. 

4. **A bus/train has broken down, and is no longer in service:** The conductor or drive realizes that the vehicle cannot operate anymore, and notifies the control center that the vehicle cannot complete the route. The system administrator uses the admin portal to navigate to the specific run, and clicks the "out of service" button, which removes the vehicle from service. 


### Notes

There are several edge cases and challenges that your interviewee should consider. Here are some questions that you can ask to help them along that process:

- What are the "nouns" associated with this system? (parts of the system)
- What are the "verbs" associated with this sytem? (actions)
- What happens when a bus/train needs to re-route, skip a stop, or if the route is out of service?
- How is this different from designing something like Venmo? (The main stakeholders or users are just people making payments to each other, as opposed to the many different stakeholders of this system [drivers, dispatches, users])

If your interviewee is stuck, start by discussing the nouns and verbs listed below, and then talk through the user stories.
