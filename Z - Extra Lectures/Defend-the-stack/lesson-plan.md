# Defend the Stack Lesson Plan

Contributions by David Adewoyin and Ben Rodriguez

## Logistics

Can be conducted:

- As part of the second capstone code review (Week 5)
- On a separate day after the second capstone code review
    - Potentially Week 6

### Prepatory Work

If conducted on a separate day:

- Instructors will reserve rooms and carve out times of at least 15 minutes for each team

## Instructor Resources

- [Rubric]('./rubric.md')
- [Script]('./script.md')

## Learning Objective

Upon completion of Defend the Stack, students will be able to:

- Effectively communicate the intention behind the architectural decisions of their projects
- Discuss the tradeoffs that come with using specific technologies
- Discuss the advantages & disadvantages of their project's architecture
- Diagram the data flow of a major vertical slice of their projects & our stack
    - Ex: Cart functionality in Grace Shopper
    - The data flow used in our stack (i.e. What happens when I click "Add to Cart" on your Grace Shopper project?)

## Needs Statements

- Students need to be able to describe their projects in detail in technical interviews.
    - Most of the questions covered in Defend the Stack are often found in the "Tell me about your project" interview
- Students need to be able to decribe the intention behind the technologies used in their projects
    - i.e. "Why use React when we could just use native Javascript?"

## Key Topics: The Whats & Whys of...

- React
- Redux
- Node
- Express
- Sequelize
- PostgreSQL/relational DBs
- Capstone technologies (i.e. Tensorflow, Firebase/Firestore, React Native, etc)
