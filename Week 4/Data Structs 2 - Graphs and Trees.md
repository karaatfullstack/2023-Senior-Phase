# FSA Lesson Plan

## REACTO - Trees and Graphs

### Daily Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Identify use cases for trees and graphs in different types of problems
- Implement and use graph and tree traversal algorithms

### Needs Statement

Students need to identify appropriate use cases for graphs and trees as well as how to traverse them using different traversal methods. This will not only help with expanding their mental model toolkit for interview questions but also identify where these data structures are used in everyday life and when might be be an appropriate time to use them in their careers.

### Key Topics

- Graphs
- Trees
- Adjacency List
- Adjacency Matrix

### Notes

- There are a lot of slides in the base deck including the skipped slides
- In order to cut down on time instructors can consider removing some things
  - Case studies of the trees (heaps, tries, etc.) that are not covered of the week
  - Case studies of Dijkstra's and A*
  - Shortening BST discussion as that is something the students do at the end Junior Phase
