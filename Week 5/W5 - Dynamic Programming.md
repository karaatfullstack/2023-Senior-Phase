# FSA Lesson Plan

## REACTO

### Daily Objectives

* Students will analyze problems for recursion use cases
	* Refactoring Iteration
	* Binary Search Trees
		* Case Study: Find BST node at depth


* Students will define dynamic programming as a problem solving technique
	* Recognizing overlapping sub-problems
	* Solve for smallest possible input, then generalize
		* Case Study: nth Fibonnaci 

* Students will identify code smells for dynamic programming
	* Permutations ("Number of ways..." Problems)
	* Min/Max related problems 
	* Nth item in series
	* Memoization for memory optimization
		* Case Study: Number of ways to climb stairs
		* Case Study: Kadane's Algorithm


### Key Topics

* Recursion
* Base/Recursive Cases
* Memoization
* Dynamic Programming
* Bottoms-up Problem Solving
* Kadane's Algorithm


### Pre-reading



### Format

  * Warm-up (5 mins)
  	* The instructor will ask students what they associate with the terms "Recursion & Dynamic Programming" and build a concept map of associated vocab (memoization, bottom's up, iteration, etc.)


  * Recursion (10 mins)
  	* The instructor will present use-cases for Recursion and walk students through BST case study

  * Think/Pair/Share nth Fibonacci (10 mins)
  	* Instructor will pair students on the nth Fibonacci problem for 5 mins and have 1-2 pairs present. 
  	* Instructor will show memoized solution (if not presented) and segue into Dynamic Programming

  * Dynamic Programming (25 mins)
  	* Instructor will define Dynamic Programming and share several code smells in popular interview problems
  	* Case Study: Staircase Problem
  		* Instructor will give students 3-5 minutes to attempt problem before sharing solution
  	* Case Study: Kadane's Algorithm
  		* Instructor will give students 3-5 minutes to attempt problem before sharing solution
