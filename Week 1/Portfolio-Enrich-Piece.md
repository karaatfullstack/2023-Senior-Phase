## Portfolio Enrichment Piece

This should be discussed sometime week 1, since students need to come up with a topic by week 3
- This same page exists in week 3 as well

### Learning Objectives


* Produce an article or video presenting a "deep dive" into a technical topic not explicitly covered in our curriculum
* Students will effectively communicate complex technical topics to a non-layman reader (or viewer)
* Students will enhance their graduation portfolio with a published article, video, etc.

### Format

Students will produce an individual report of one of the following formats:

* Exploration of new technology, or comparison of multiple technologies (e.g, React Hooks vs Redux)
* Technology Tutorial
* Data Structure/Algorithm walkthrough
* Applied use-case of ADT/Algo
* Overview of Industry Best Practices (DevOps, Agile, etc.)

### Review Sessions

* Students will work in pre-assigned review groups of 2-3 students to share and draft their PEPs.
  * These groups can be assigned either at the start of the cohort, or at the start of week 6 for final review.
* Peer reviewers are also responsible for leaving upvotes/positive comments on their groupmates' published PEPs.

### Submission Due Dates:

* Friday, Week 3: Topics Due
* Friday, Week 6: Final Submission Due

### Specifications:
- Written PEPs should be ~1000 words in length and published to Medium
