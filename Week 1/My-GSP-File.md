# Grace Shopper Project by Day

## Day 1

1. [Cover GSP Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1viYNLnRmv2z2hMq1MrX7mvNxWIXif8Kz/edit#slide=id.p1)
2. Go over how [Code Reviews](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/program-guide-web-core/blob/main/04-sr-phase/02-grace-shopper/03-Sprint-Meetings.md) will work
  - Note that I should pitch these as "Demo" sessions instead of CRs, and should make my own (simplified) sheet for this
3.  Discuss what the project tiers look like using [this resource](https://github.com/karaatfullstack/2023-Senior-Phase/blob/main/Week%201/Grace-shopper/02-Tiers.md)
  - The tiers are listed in Canvas for the students

[This is the form](https://github.com/karaatfullstack/2023-Senior-Phase/blob/main/Week%201/Grace-shopper/04-Teams.md) I can copy to keep track of teams
