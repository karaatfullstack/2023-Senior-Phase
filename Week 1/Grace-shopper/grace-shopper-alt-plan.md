# Grace Shopper Planning Activity (all times approximate)

# Working Together Group Discussion (25 minutes)

## Full Group Discussion (3 minutes)

Ask by show of hands "Who has worked on a group project that went poorly?"
Follow with general discussion on the topic, "Why is working in teams
difficult?

## Split students into groups of ~4

## Groups Generate Case Studies (8 minutes)

Each group types out ~4 case-studies of real life scenarios where a teamwork
situation they were a part of fell apart. They can discuss what went wrong and
what could have been done to make things better. These “solutions” are not
typed out.

## Groups Discuss Case Studies  (8 minutes)

Teams slack their list of case studies to another team. And those teams now
discuss how those case-studies could have gone better.

## Full Group Discussion (6 minutes)

Teams report back on their general insights and topics of discussion.

# Team Making (20 minutes)

Introduce the Establishing Norms questions and the Sample Team Contract.

Slack out the Grace Shopper Teams.

It is important to withhold the announcement of the teams right until this
point. The workshop activity about teamwork is still top of mind. Do not
introduce the project in detail itself until after the norms and contract
activity is complete. This serves to enforce that the practicing of a
developer's working process is more important than the product being built.

# Introduce Grace Shopper (10-20 minutes)

# Planning Activity (a while)

## Teams read through requirements / begin their plan of attack (30-60 minutes)

Somewhere around 30-45 minutes many of the teams have begun wireframing and
diagramming schemas. Fellows are usually beginning to interact and help guide
the process.

## Cross-pollination (15 minutes)

Once teams are getting into the groove of their planning have teams interview
each-other so the best ideas/approaches from all teams can spread to the other
teams.

Each team elects two delegates to talk to other teams. One delegate rotates to
the next team in the room, and the other delegate rotates two teams away.

Each working group during this activity consists of:
* Two members of the team ( one if the team was a team of three)
* One member from a second team
* One member from a third team

The “interlopers” interview the two core team members about their team’s schema
design, verticals, wireframes and overall planning approach

Set a visible timer to cap these conversations to 10 minutes.
